## DATABASE: Schema Design
**Date**: 2025-10-16T00:45:00.000Z
**Description**: Created two-table schema: tickets and timeline with foreign key relationship
**Tables**:
- `tickets`: Stores ticket data with indexes on pipeline and status
- `timeline`: Stores activity history with foreign key to tickets
**Rationale**: 
- Normalized design prevents data duplication
- Indexes on commonly filtered fields improve query performance
- Foreign key constraint maintains referential integrity
**Impact**: Efficient queries, data integrity maintained

---

## FEATURE: Sankey Diagram Visualization
**Date**: 2025-10-16T01:00:00.000Z
**Description**: Added Sankey diagram tab using Plotly.js to visualize ticket flows
**Rationale**: 
- Visual representation helps identify bottlenecks
- Management can quickly see pipeline distribution
- Interactive diagram provides drill-down capability
**Technology**: Plotly.js chosen for rich interactivity without complex setup
**Impact**: Enhanced visibility into system state and workflow efficiency

**Description**: Implemented comprehensive automated testing system
**Coverage**:
- API endpoint testing (CRUD operations)
- Filter and search functionality
- Data integrity validation
- Performance benchmarks
- Edge case and error handling
**Rationale**: 
- Automated tests prevent regressions
- Ensures reliability in manufacturing environment where downtime is costly
- Provides confidence when making changes
**Tools**: Axios for API testing, custom test runner for flexibility
**Impact**: Improved code quality, faster development cycles

---

## DOCUMENTATION: Decision Logging System
**Date**: 2025-10-16T01:45:00.000Z
**Description**: Created automated decision logging integrated with test suite
**Purpose**: 
- Track all significant decisions and changes
- Maintain institutional knowledge
- Audit trail for compliance
- Onboarding documentation for new team members
**Format**: Markdown for human readability and version control compatibility
**Impact**: Improved project transparency and knowledge retention

---

## API: RESTful Design Pattern
**Date**: 2025-10-16T00:20:00.000Z
**Description**: Implemented standard REST API with proper HTTP methods
**Endpoints**:
- GET /api/tickets - List tickets with filtering
- POST /api/tickets - Create ticket
- PUT /api/tickets/:id - Update ticket
- DELETE /api/tickets/:id - Delete ticket
- GET /api/stats - Pipeline statistics
**Rationale**: 
- Standard REST patterns are well understood
- Easy to extend and integrate with other systems
- Clear separation of concerns
**Impact**: Maintainable, scalable API design

---

## SECURITY: Local Network Deployment
**Date**: 2025-10-16T00:10:00.000Z
**Description**: System designed for local network deployment without internet exposure
**Considerations**:
- No authentication required (local network trust)
- CORS enabled for local network access
- SQLite database file permissions rely on OS security
**Future Consideration**: Add authentication layer if system is exposed beyond local network
**Impact**: Simplified deployment, appropriate security for local network environment

---

## UI/UX: Tab-Based Navigation
**Date**: 2025-10-16T01:00:00.000Z
**Description**: Implemented tab navigation between Tickets view and Sankey diagram view
**Rationale**: 
- Reduces cognitive load by separating operational and analytical views
- Maintains all functionality on single page application
- Faster navigation than multi-page approach
**Impact**: Improved user experience, cleaner interface

---

## PERFORMANCE: Database Indexing Strategy
**Date**: 2025-10-16T00:50:00.000Z
**Description**: Added indexes on frequently queried fields (pipeline, status)
**Query Patterns Optimized**:
- Filter by pipeline
- Filter by status  
- Combined pipeline + status queries
**Rationale**: 
- These are the most common filter operations
- Indexes improve query speed significantly with larger datasets
**Trade-off**: Slightly slower writes, much faster reads (acceptable for read-heavy workload)
**Impact**: Maintains performance as ticket volume grows

---

## DATA: Sample Data Strategy
**Date**: 2025-10-16T00:40:00.000Z
**Description**: Server automatically populates sample tickets on first run
**Rationale**: 
- Provides immediate value for evaluation
- Demonstrates all features
- Serves as examples for users
**Implementation**: Check ticket count on startup, insert samples if zero
**Impact**: Better first-run experience, easier testing

---

## OPERATIONS: Process Management Recommendation
**Date**: 2025-10-16T01:20:00.000Z
**Description**: Documented PM2 process manager for production deployment
**Rationale**: 
- Automatic restart on crashes
- Startup on system boot
- Log management
- Zero-downtime deployment capability
**Impact**: Improved reliability for production use

## SCALABILITY: Future Considerations
**Date**: 2025-10-16T01:50:00.000Z
**Description**: Identified potential scaling paths for future growth
**Paths**:
1. PostgreSQL migration for larger datasets
2. Redis caching layer for high-traffic scenarios
3. WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
4. Microservices architecture if system scope expands
**Current Status**: SQLite and polling approach sufficient for initial deployment
**Review Trigger**: Re-evaluate when ticket volume exceeds 10,000 or concurrent users exceed 20
**Impact**: Clear path forward for growth

---

## MAINTENANCE: Backup Strategy
**Date**: 2025-10-16T01:25:00.000Z
**Description**: Recommended daily SQLite database backups
**Implementation**: 
- Simple file copy of tickets.db
- Cron job or Windows Task Scheduler
- Retain 30 days of backups
**Rationale**: 
- SQLite databases are single files, easy to backup
- Manufacturing data has compliance requirements
- Recovery time objective: <1 hour
**Impact**: Data protection, compliance readiness
