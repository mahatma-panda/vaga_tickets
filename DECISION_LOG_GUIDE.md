# Decision Log Guide

## Purpose

The Decision Log (`DECISION_LOG.md`) is a living document that records all significant decisions, changes, and events in the project lifecycle. It serves as:

- **Historical Record**: Track why decisions were made
- **Knowledge Base**: Help new team members understand the system
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain compliance and accountability
- **Communication Tool**: Share decisions across the team
- **Learning Resource**: Learn from past successes and mistakes

## How to Add Entries

### Manual Entries

Add entries directly to `DECISION_LOG.md`:

```markdown
## CATEGORY: Decision Title
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ (use ISO 8601 format)
**Description**: Detailed description of the decision or change
**Rationale**: Why this decision was made
**Alternatives Considered**: Other options evaluated (optional)
**Impact**: Expected effects on system/users
**Risks**: Potential risks or concerns (optional)
**Follow-up**: Future actions needed (optional)

---
```

### Automated Entries (from Tests)

The test suite automatically logs entries:

```javascript
runner.logDecision(
    'CATEGORY',
    'Decision Title',
    'Description',
    { /* optional metadata */ }
);
```

### Programmatic Entries (from Application)

Add to your application code when needed:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

function logDecision(category, title, description, metadata = {}) {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
    const entry = `
## ${category}: ${title}
**Date**: ${timestamp}
**Description**: ${description}
${Object.keys(metadata).length > 0 ? 
    `**Metadata**: ${JSON.stringify(metadata, null, 2)}` : ''}

---
`;
    fs.appendFileSync('./DECISION_LOG.md', entry);
}

// Usage example
logDecision(
    'FEATURE',
    'Email Notifications Enabled',
    'Users now receive email notifications when tickets are assigned to them',
    { emailProvider: 'SendGrid', affectedUsers: 50 }
);
```

## Entry Categories

Use these standardized categories for consistency:

### Technical Categories

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific

```markdown
❌ Bad:
## FEATURE: Added new thing
**Description**: Made improvements

✅ Good:
## FEATURE: Sankey Diagram Visualization
**Description**: Added interactive Sankey diagram to visualize ticket flow 
between pipelines and statuses using Plotly.js library
**Rationale**: Management requested visual representation to identify 
bottlenecks in the workflow
**Impact**: Users can now quickly identify which pipelines have the most 
pending tickets
```

### 2. Include Rationale

Always explain WHY, not just WHAT:

```markdown
## ARCHITECTURE: Switched to SQLite
**Description**: Migrated from PostgreSQL to SQLite
**Rationale**: 
- Deployment complexity reduced (no separate database server needed)
- Local network deployment is simplified
- Performance sufficient for expected workload (<50 concurrent users)
- Backup process simplified (single file copy)
**Trade-offs**: 
- Less suitable for >50 concurrent users
- Fewer advanced features than PostgreSQL
- May need migration if system scales beyond current requirements
```

### 3. Document Trade-offs

```markdown
## PERFORMANCE: Implemented Caching
**Description**: Added Redis caching layer for statistics endpoint
**Benefits**:
- 80% reduction in database queries
- Response time improved from 200ms to 30ms
**Trade-offs**:
- Additional infrastructure complexity (Redis server)
- Cache invalidation logic required
- Potential for stale data (5-minute cache)
**Decision**: Benefits outweigh costs for this high-traffic endpoint
```

### 4. Link Related Entries

```markdown
## BUGFIX: Timeline Sorting Issue
**Description**: Fixed timeline entries appearing in wrong order
**Root Cause**: JavaScript date parsing inconsistency
**Related Decisions**: 
- See "DATABASE: Timeline Schema" (2025-10-16)
- See "FEATURE: Activity Timeline" (2025-10-16)
**Resolution**: Store timestamps as ISO 8601 strings in database
```

### 5. Include Metadata

Add structured data for easier searching:

```markdown
## INTEGRATION: Slack Notifications
**Description**: Added Slack integration for high-priority tickets
**Metadata**:
```json
{
  "slackChannel": "#manufacturing-alerts",
  "triggerConditions": ["priority:high", "status:new"],
  "affectedPipelines": ["orders", "support"],
  "implementation": "webhook",
  "responseTime": "< 2 seconds"
}
```
**Impact**: Critical issues now have 15-minute average response time 
(down from 2 hours)
```

## Review and Maintenance

### Weekly Review

- Check for missing entries
- Ensure recent changes are documented
- Update status of pending items
- Archive very old entries (optional)

### Monthly Review

- Analyze decision patterns
- Identify areas needing documentation
- Update DECISION_LOG_GUIDE if needed
- Share key decisions in team meetings

### Quarterly Review

- Export major decisions for stakeholder review
- Create summary report of significant changes
- Plan documentation improvements
- Archive or reorganize if file becomes too large

**Author**: Jane Smith
**Approved By**: CTO, Legal Team
**Description**: Implemented automatic data deletion after 7 years
**Compliance**: GDPR Article 5(1)(e)
**Rationale**: Legal requirement for data minimization
**Implementation**: Automated cron job + manual review process
**Verification**: Quarterly audit of retention periods
**Impact**: Reduces data storage and compliance risk
**Audit Log**: All deletions logged to audit_log.db

---
```

## Troubleshooting

### Decision Log Too Large

If file exceeds 5MB:

1. Archive old entries:
```bash
# Create archive
head -n 1000 DECISION_LOG.md > DECISION_LOG_2024.md
tail -n +1001 DECISION_LOG.md > DECISION_LOG_temp.md
mv DECISION_LOG_temp.md DECISION_LOG.md
```

2. Or split by year:
```bash
grep "2024" DECISION_LOG.md > DECISION_LOG_2024.md
```

### Merge Conflicts

When multiple people edit simultaneously:

1. Always pull before adding entries
2. Add entries at the end (less conflict)
3. Use descriptive commit messages
4. Resolve conflicts by keeping both entries

### Missing Context

If entries lack context:

1. Add "Background" section to entries
2. Link to related documentation
3. Reference relevant tickets/issues
4. Include screenshots or diagrams
